                            <p>Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. It runs on the BEAM virtual machine. A peer node has a lot of different components - ex. consensus, mining, networking and peer discovery and communication. Dimitar and his team have also built their own smart contract virtual machine. Some other hard requirements are determinism and portability. In this talk, Dimitar will share his experience with all of those running on the BEAM.</p>
